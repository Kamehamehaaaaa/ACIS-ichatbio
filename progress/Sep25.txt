Explored LangChain and its alternatives like LlamaIndex and HayStack.

LlamaIndex is sounds interesting too but LangChain is better suited for tool calling. LlamaIndex is best used for RAG and data connection to LLM models.

Havent started coding a lot with LangChain as I wanted to explore different options available for tool calling.

Anisa recommended a course on Pydantic framework on DeepLearningAI. Started on the course. Explored Tools Calling using pydantic model.
